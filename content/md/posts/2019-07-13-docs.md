##Customer Testimonial

##Why us?

### You need a consultant to clarify your problems 

### You need correct, well-tested software

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a program in possession of good quality, must be well-tested. With Clojure as our primary programming language, every expression we write is tested through REPL environment. This is not the granulartiy of unit test but the granularity of expression test. In addition, REPL-driven development is not like test-driven development that programmers need to invest certain amount of time on writing tests. We deliver well-tested software without slowing down.

### You need immutable database

Consider that you have a RDBMS database with an order table inside. Last week, there were a lot of orders inserted, and you could query the database to get the revenue last week. This week, some orders updated, and you can still query the database to get the revenue this week. What if you forget the revenue number last week, and you want to reproduce the revenue from database? You can not make it because certain orders have been updated. With datomic, the immutable database, you can easily get the last week revenue by simply asking the database to go back to the state last week.
