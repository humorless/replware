I am **Laurence Chen**, and **REPLWARE** is my IT consulting company.

My mission is to empower senior technical people to operate more effectively at the strategic level and communicate with a high degree of clarity.

Many technical departments share a common problem: Working hard day after day, but still chasing the deadline. As more things are built, productivity and efficiency does not grow proportionately because resources are becoming more constrained by maintenance over time. The crux of the problem is that we usually do not work at the domain problem level and are dragged into low-level details too often. In other words, we do not work strategically enough.

That is why you need me: I can collaborate with you, transfer necessary knowledge to you and your team, and  thus prepare you with the capability to achieve fast and sustainable results.
