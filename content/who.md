I am **Laurence Chen**, and **REPLWARE** is my IT consulting company.

My mission is simple: I want to bring productivity to people. The productivity improvements can be in many different forms: software development, data analytics, debugging workflow, or strategy formulation.

Most companies agree on higher productivity, but the way towards higher productivity, full of experiments and ambiguities, is sometimes intimidating. That is why you need me: I can collaborate with you, transfer necessary knowledge to your team, and thus achieve fast and sustainable results.
