**Laurence Chen | Platform Architecture & Organizational Design Consultant**

I help enterprises realign technology with business by designing **clear platform boundaries and operating models**, enabling technology to support growth rather than becoming a source of friction.

My work focuses on identifying capabilities that are repeatedly built across teams—and intentionally elevating them into stable, shared platforms. I specialize in the planning and implementation of three core organizational platforms: **Data**, **Workflow**, and **Auth**.

As systems grow, many organizations experience rising maintenance costs and slowing R&D speed. The root cause is often not technical complexity itself, but **unclear responsibility boundaries and a lack of strategic division of labor** across teams.

Drawing on *Team Topologies* principles, I help enterprises:

**Define Platform Boundaries and Responsibilities**: Clarify which capabilities should remain close to business execution, and which should be centralized as shared platforms with clear ownership and interfaces.

**Design Platform Operating Models**: Establish how platform teams evaluate priorities, provide self-service capabilities, and evolve sustainably without becoming approval bottlenecks.

**Reduce Organizational Cognitive Load**: Through deliberate separation of *what* from *how*, I enable business-facing teams to focus on delivering business value, while platforms provide stable, reusable foundations for the organization.
