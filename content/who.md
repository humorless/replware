I am **Laurence Chen**, and **REPLWARE** is my IT consulting company.

My mission is to empower technology professionals, especially CTOs, CIOs, and CDOs, enabling them to operate efficiently at the strategic level and communicate effectively with a high degree of clarity.

As a technical professional, are you actively involved in strategic-level work? Perhaps you participate in daily strategic meetings within the company, possibly overseeing multiple subordinates. In terms of management, you harness the capabilities of individuals to enhance overall productivity. How about on the technical side? Are you fully utilizing the available technical resources?

This is where I come in. I can collaborate with you, impart necessary knowledge to both you and your team, and consequently, achieve rapid and sustainable results.
