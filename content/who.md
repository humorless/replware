I am **Laurence Chen**, and **REPLWARE** is my IT consulting company.

My mission is to empower senior technical people to operate effectively at the strategic level and communicate with a high degree of clarity.

Many technical departments have the same problem: Working hard day after day, but still chasing the deadline. The more things we build, the more there are to maintain. The essence of the problem is that we usually do not work at the domain problem level and are dragged into low-level details too often. In other words, we do not work strategically enough.

That is why you need me: I can collaborate with you, transfer necessary knowledge to you and your team, and thus achieve fast and sustainable results.
