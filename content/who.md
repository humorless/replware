**Laurence Chen | REPLWARE Platform Engineering Consultant**

I am dedicated to helping enterprises achieve true alignment between technology and business through Platform Engineering. I specialize in the planning and implementation of three core platforms: **Data**, **Workflow**, and **Auth**.

The dilemma many technical teams face is that as systems grow, maintenance costs inadvertently slow down R&D speed. This is often due to blurred platform boundaries and a lack of "strategic division of labor." Leveraging Team Topologies principles, I assist companies in:

**Implementing Standardized Infrastructure:** Deploying Modern Data Stack, Workflow Engine, and SSO to realize the principle of "Separate What and How."

**Designing Platform Operating Models:** Defining platform team boundaries, evaluating requirement priorities, and establishing efficient Developer Self-Service.

**Optimizing Organizational Cognitive Load:** Through a strategic division of labor, I empower product teams to focus on business value, turning technology into an engine for growth rather than a bottleneck.
