I am **Laurence Chen**, and **REPLWARE** is my IT consulting company.

My mission is simple. I want to help successful people use top technology: for themselves, their customers, and their teams. I help executives use technology well to achieve greater success.

I build concept-to-production real-world software, introduce data literacy, and improve the debugging workflow. My clients describe my work as delivering on time, with an innovative approach.
