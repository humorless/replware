I am **Laurence Chen**, and REPLware is my one-man software consulting company.

According the report from the Standish Group, only [16.2%](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf) of software projects are completed on time and on budget. The top three of the project challenged factors are: Lack of user input, incomplete requirements and changing requirements.

I have been developing software for ten years. Understanding the challenges mentioned above, I deliberately choose to work as one-man team, which makes me communicating with my clients more. Also, I choose Clojure/ClojureScript/Datomic as my primary technical stacks. The Clojure programming language helps me to conquer the challenge of changing requirements.
